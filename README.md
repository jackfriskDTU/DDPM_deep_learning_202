### Overview and Objective
The DDPM is a latent variable generative model that gradually adds noise to data during a forward process and learns to reverse this process to generate high-quality samples. The objective is to re-implement this model in PyTorch and reproduce the results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

### Steps to Re-Implement DDPM
1. **Understand the Diffusion Process:**
   - The forward process involves gradually adding noise to an image over several steps using a variance schedule, which turns the data into noise.
   - The reverse process is a trained Markov chain that tries to reverse this noise addition to recover the original data.
   - Both the forward and reverse processes are parameterized using Gaussian noise, with the forward variances denoted as `β_t`.

2. **Training Objective and Simplified Objective:**
   - Training is performed using a variational bound to maximize the likelihood of generating real data.
   - The paper proposes an `ε`-prediction approach, which allows the use of a simplified training objective (`Lsimple`). We will implement this as it simplifies training and gives better sample quality.

3. **Network Architecture:**
   - Implement a **U-Net** backbone similar to PixelCNN++ for the reverse process. The U-Net will take the noisy image at each time step `t` as input and output a prediction of the original noise.
   - Use **group normalization** and **self-attention** layers for feature extraction.

4. **Training Strategy:**
   - Start by implementing the forward diffusion process. Define a variance schedule for adding Gaussian noise to the images, such as linearly increasing from `β1 = 10^-4` to `βT = 0.02` with `T = 1000` steps.
   - Implement the reverse process, where a neural network is trained to estimate the noise added during the forward process.
   - Use the **simplified loss function** (`Lsimple`) to train the network, which essentially makes the model learn to denoise images at different levels of noise.

5. **Datasets:**
   - Implement training on **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10**.
   - Make sure to preprocess the datasets by scaling the images to `[-1, 1]` and use random horizontal flips during training for CIFAR-10 to improve generalization.

6. **Sampling Procedure:**
   - Implement the sampling algorithm, which involves starting from a random Gaussian sample (`x_T ~ N(0, I)`) and iteratively reversing the noise using the trained neural network to generate realistic images.
   - Follow **Algorithm 2** in the paper to implement this process.

7. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Measure the quality of generated images using metrics like **Inception Score (IS)** and **Fréchet Inception Distance (FID)**. For MNIST, visual inspection of generated digits is often used as a benchmark.
   - Compare the generated sample quality to ensure that results are similar to or better than those reported in the paper (e.g., FID of ~3.17 on CIFAR-10).

8. **Implementation Considerations:**
   - Make use of **TPU or GPU** for faster training, as diffusion models can be computationally intensive.
   - Ensure hyperparameter choices such as learning rate, batch size, and variance schedules match those used in the paper.

### Project Outline
1. **Set Up Environment:**
   - Install necessary libraries (`PyTorch`, `torchvision`, etc.).
   - Prepare scripts for data loading, model architecture, and training.

2. **Implement the Forward Process:**
   - Code the forward diffusion process where Gaussian noise is added to the images in a sequence.

3. **Implement the Reverse Process:**
   - Implement the U-Net model and write the training loop using the simplified objective.
   - Train on MNIST first, then move to CIFAR-10 after validating the implementation.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Implement sampling and evaluate the model's ability to generate realistic images.
   - Compute IS and FID metrics for CIFAR-10 and qualitatively assess MNIST samples.

5. **Results Reproduction:**
   - Compare generated samples with those from the original paper and adjust the architecture or training strategy as necessary.
